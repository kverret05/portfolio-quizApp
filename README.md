# quizApp


Plan on adding two additional components:


Restart Quiz Component with confirmation
If the user confirms, the quiz will be restarted, and all states in other components will be reset to their initial values.
If the user cancels, the quiz will continue as usual, and the state of the Restart Quiz component will be reset to false.

Hint component
